[**Modeling Health Insurance**](https://github.com/Chris-Raddatz/DataQuest-DataScience-Projects/blob/main/Insurance%20Prices.ipynb)
- In this project I build use exploratory data analysis to pick features for a LinearRegression model and analyze the parameters of my model and it's accuracy.

[**Credit Card Segmentation**](https://github.com/Chris-Raddatz/DataQuest-DataScience-Projects/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Project.ipynb)
- This project focused on clusterization, and analyzing data based on said clusters to target customers for their financial status. Used KMeans and Inertia plots to identify number of clusters. Seaborn and Matplotlib used for plotting.

[**Predicting Heart Disease**](https://github.com/Chris-Raddatz/DataQuest-DataScience-Projects/blob/main/Heart%20Disease.ipynb)
- I cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis and then used KNeighborClassifier and GridSearchCV to fit a model with around 85% accuracy.
